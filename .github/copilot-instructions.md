# Discord AI Bot Project Instructions

This project is a Discord chatting bot that uses multiple AI APIs for cost efficiency:
- Gemini API for image generation 
- Perplexity AI for text/chat responses
- Smart routing system to minimize costs while maintaining functionality

## Development Guidelines
- Use Node.js and Discord.js for the bot framework
- Implement proper error handling and rate limiting
- Keep API keys secure using environment variables
- Structure code for easy maintenance and scaling

## API Integration
- Gemini: Image generation and visual content
- Perplexity: Text responses and general chat
- Future: Additional APIs can be added to the routing system

## Security
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use .env files for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper authentication and validation
